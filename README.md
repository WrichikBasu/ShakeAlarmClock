Tired of pressing the power button/swiping the screen every time an alarm rings? Does your phone's UI have a tendency to freeze, thereby making it impossible to dismiss an alarm? No worries! You have come to the right place. With this app, you can simply shake your phone and dismiss the alarm.


## Salient features:
1. Works offline.
1. The alarm is handled by a service which has almost no dependency with the UI. So, even if your UI freezes, the alarm will ring and can be dismissed.
1. Uses latest Android Room database for storing alarms.
1. Inbuilt dark theme, even in phones that do not support it.
1. Snooze your alarm as many times as you want with custom snooze options.
1. Actively maintained app. Bug reports will be worked upon with high priority.
