# Welcome to Shake Alarm Clock!

Issues and suggestions for improvements are always welcome. Anyone is allowed to fork this repository, make changes and submit a pull request (PR). We will be happy to make changes to the app for making it better.

However, before contributing, please read the following guidelines:

## Guidelines for creating an issue:
Issue templates have been set up for bug reports and feature requests separately. Please try to follow them. If, however, you find that what you have in mind cannot be written properly in the provided template, you may create an issue from a blank template.

## Guidelines for forking and creating pull requests:
1. Do **not** change the following:
   - Gradle version
   - Android SDK version
   - Build tools version
   - Version of any other third-party library, even if it is outdated
   - App version and/or version codes  
   I will change the app version before creating a release.
1. Please try to make a logical series of commits in your PR such that they have meaning when someone looks at the history of the project. If this is not followed, I will do a squash merge rather than normal merge (doing so will put all your commits into one single commit in the history of your project).
1. It's upto the owner to decide whether the PR will be simply merged, or squashed.
1. Follow the "one feature one PR" rule: each PR should add only one feature to the app. You can add as many commits as you want for introducing the feature, but these changes should cater to only one feature.
1. Document your code where necessary. Changes without proper documentation may not be accepted.
